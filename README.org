* Introduction

  This is a collection of functions I am writing in order to make my
  clocking workflows easier.

  My aim is to do as much of the clocking from the agenda buffer
  without ever having to leave it, except to open a new task.

  [[file:./org-clock-conv.gif]]


* Motivation
  It happens quite often that I get distracted by other tasks, e.g. a
  colleague ivolving me in a longer discussion, while I am still
  clocked in to the previous task. So, frequently I need to adapt the
  clock history to fill gaps or to correct for tasks happening when I
  was not in front of the screen. I want to have my whole day clocked
  seemlessly, and I have done so over the last 4 years using Org.
  Formerly, this involved a lot of jumping to the clock lines of org
  files to adapt the timestamps, which is cumbersome and needs time.
  
  I always wanted to have commands with which I can change the clock
  values directly *from the log lines in the agenda view* in the same
  way that one can change timestamps under the cursor inside of an org
  file using =org-timestamp-up= and =org-timestamp-down= (usually
  mapped to =<S-up>= and =<S-down>=).

* Interactive functions
  - =org-clock-conv-timestamp-up= and =org-clock-conv-timestamp-down=:
    When on a /clocked/ line in the agenda buffer, this function will
    increase/decrease the time according to the position of the
    cursor. If the cursor is on the hour field, change the hour. If it
    is on the minutes field, change the minutes. Undo works on the
    agenda and on the source buffer.
  - =org-clock-conv-fill-gap= modifies the timestamp at point to
    connect to the previous/next logged timerange.
  - =org-clock-conv-goto-ts= goto the associated timestamp in the org
    file. Position the cursor respective to where the cursor was
    placed in the agenda view (e.g. on the minutes part of the
    starting time).
  - =org-clock-conv-goto-last-clockout=: goto timestamp of the last
    clockout (this is based on a real search through the buffer and
    not based on the saved clockout value).

  Note that the agenda clock changing commands work with *undo* in the
  same way as other org agenda commands. They will undo in the agenda
  buffer as well as in the org source buffers. But if the agenda
  buffer is rebuilt after a change (e.g. by =g=), the undo information
  is lost.
  
  The package also contains a number of utility functions to associate
  a list with fieldnames with the subgroup of a regular expression and
  position point at a named field or read its value.

* Installation

  - I am currently preparing packaging for MELPA.
  - You can always install the raw package an then do
    #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :exports source
      (require 'org-clock-convenience)
    #+END_SRC

  I did not include a minor mode, since I think that these commands will be bound
  in a very individual way by users. I recommend defining a setup function and
  adding it to the functions run by =org-agenda-mode-hook= like here:

  #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :exports source
    (defun dfeich/org-agenda-mode-fn ()
      (define-key org-agenda-mode-map
        (kbd "<S-up>") #'org-clock-conv-timestamp-up)
      (define-key org-agenda-mode-map
        (kbd "<S-down>") #'org-clock-conv-timestamp-down)
      (define-key org-agenda-mode-map
        (kbd "ö") #'org-clock-conv-fill-gap))
    (add-hook 'org-agenda-mode-hook #'dfeich/org-agenda-mode-fn)
  #+END_SRC

** Tip: using helm for efficient clocking into tasks

   In order not having to leave the agenda view for clocking into a
   task that is not displayed in some way in the agenda view (where
   you could use =I= with cursor on the task), I customize [[https://emacs-helm.github.io/helm/][helm]]. It is
   easy to just add the clocking-in as another possible action to the
   =helm-org-agenda-files-headings= command:
   
   #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :exports source
     (defun dfeich/helm-org-clock-in (marker)
       "Clock into the item at MARKER"
       (with-current-buffer (marker-buffer marker)
         (goto-char (marker-position marker))
         (org-clock-in)))
     (eval-after-load 'helm-org
       '(nconc helm-org-headings-actions
               (list
                (cons "Clock into task" #'dfeich/helm-org-clock-in))))
   #+END_SRC
  
* Current shortcomings
  - Agenda view sometimes needs two rebuilds (using =g=) after modifying. This is
    a minor invonvenience, and I need to investigate.
  - the calculated time span in the agenda buffer (the duration given
    in parentheses in each clock line) is only corrected after the
    user rebuilds the buffer. Since the changed fields are clearly marked by the
    temporary font, and the time span is clearly not marked, this should not
    confuse the user. I consider this secondary for the moment and will maybe
    add it at some point.
